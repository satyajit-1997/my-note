# Modules

A module is an encapsulated and reusable chunk of code that has its own context in Node.js, each file is treated as a separate module

Types of Modules

1. Local Modules - Modules that we create in our application
2. Built-in Modules - Modules that Node.js ships with out-of-the-box
3. Third-party modules - Modules written by other developers that we can use in our application
